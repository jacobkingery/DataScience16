    "Suppose one of your co-workers is expecting a baby and you are participating in an office pool to predict the date of birth. Assuming that bets are placed during the 30th week of pregnancy, what variables could you use to make the best prediction? You should limit yourself to variables that are known before the birth, and likely to be available to the people in the pool. "

Three of the next four columns are related to the length of the pregnancy which is also unknown until after the fact.  The other column is the mother's age at conception, but this seems redundant since we're already using the mother's age at the end of the pregnancy.  The sex of the baby is pretty high on the list and is most likely known by the 30th week of the pregnancy.  Race is the next highest factor, but as the reading mentions, can sometimes be coupled with various socioeconomic factors.  Out of the remaining columns, number of babies in the pregnancy, whether the mother owns or rents a home, and the mother's total family income could be known or reasonably estimated."

    "Taking the model that Allen described in _ThinkStats_, I decided to make a slight modification regarding how multiple babies were handled.  My hypothesis was that I would be able to get better results by looking at this categorically (how many babies are in the pregnancy?) rather than as a boolean (is there more than one baby in the pregnancy?).  My reasoning is that it seems to me that triplets would each weigh less than twins who would each weigh less than a single child, and the specific number of babies in the pregnancy would probably be known.  The slight improvment in R$^2$ value seems to indicate that being more specific about this factor would improve your odds in guessing the weight of the baby/babies (though it's still not that much of an improvement over guessing without taking these factors into account)."
